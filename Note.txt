You need to create all file with "same name" as given like popup.js etc because chrome understand this file only with this name like 
popup.js,popup.html and manifest.json
3 file with icon.png is must to run ur extension in chrome browser properly.

Note:This is cross platform extension so it run in edge,chrome,firefox,safari etc because all browser understand manifest.json file,popup.js etc
bootstrap.min.css is bootstrap file to provide good look to ur extension nothing else.

Note:
In extension manifest.json is used for load ur html file in chrome as extension.
In popup.html and popup.js we write logic and GUI code.
Extension is nothing but small html page that set.
If we add extension in browser then functionality of brower get increases like open camera and voice recording this feature not available in chrome directly so we use 
extension.

Note: This is standard formate of extension development so follow it "as it is".
